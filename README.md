# Individual project Documentation

## Project Description:

The application will allow a user to create new
tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to. They will
need to use a text based user interface via the command-line. Once they are using the application, the user should be able to
also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file,
and then restart the application with the former state restored.

The interface should look similar the mockup below.
